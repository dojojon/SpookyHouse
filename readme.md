# PyGame Halloween House 

We are going to learn how to program a "Spooky House" halloween game using Python and Pygame.

Whilst you can follow this tutorial without any programming or Python experience, but it's a good idea to have completed through the Beginners Python (http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Beginner_Python) and Intermediate Python (http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Intermediate_Python) Sushi Cards if you have no experience.

## Getting Set Up

1.  Before you can start coding, you'll need to setup your computer to writePython. You'll need to have Python and a text editor installed, and know how to run a Python program.

2. To install Python, go to http://dojo.soy/py-setup and click on the Download
Python 3 button. There will be some other numbers after the 3, but they
change too often for me to include them. Don't worry about them.
Once the installer has downloaded, start it and click through it, accepting
the default choices.

3. Now you need to get a text editor, to write your Python in. We
recommend Atom, which you can download from http://atom.io, but you
can use another editor if you're more familiar with it. Or just like it better.

4. Once you have both of these setup, you're ready to go. You just need to
make sure that everything is working and that you know how to run a
Python program. Follow these steps:

* Make a new folder for your Spooky House game.
* Open your text editor and create a new file. Save it into the folder
you just made and call it game.py.
* Open the command line on your computer (called command prompt
on Windows and Terminal on Mac) and navigate to your folder using
the cd command.
 * Once you've opened your folder in the command line, you're ready
to try running this blank file with this command, entered into the
command line:

```
python3 game.py
```

Note: On Windows you may need to use python rather than python3.

If this has worked, you shouldn't see any messages when you run
the command.

5. Next we need to install the PyGame (http://Pygame.org) library.

* Open the command line on your computer
* Run the following command to install the pygame library

```
python3 -m pip install pygame --user
```

To see if it works, run one of the included examples:

```
python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
```

If it works, you are ready to go!
